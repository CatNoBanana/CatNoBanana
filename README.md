- 👋 Hi, I’m @CatNoBanana
- 👀 I’m interested in helping further free, open source material for the benefit of all mankind, but mostly I want a personal AI bot that can be a second brain for me on my phone.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, SNHU.
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on game development at the moment. My prefered engine is Godot.
- 📫 How to reach me send me an email @ JudsonHunt20@gmail.com
